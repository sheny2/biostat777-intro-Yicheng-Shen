# biostat777-intro-Yicheng-Shen

This is a repo for files from my very new website: https://yichengshen.quarto.pub/my-very-new-website/

The repo includes `qmd` files for each of the webpages (Home, About, and Example Data Analysis), as well as all the pictures used. 

You can switch it to dark mode whenever you want! 

As you probably notice from the url, this website is deployed on Quarto Pub. The deployment is excuated through the `quarto publish` command from my local directory.
